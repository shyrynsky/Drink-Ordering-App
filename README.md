# OOP Fundamentals Study Project

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a course on Object-Oriented Programming Technologies to study and understand the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It demonstrates core OOP concepts and various design patterns through practical implementations.

## Project Functionality
The project is a Windows Forms application that allows users to add, store, and delete orders for various drinks. It also supports serialization and deserialization of orders into different formats. Additionally, the application can load plugins that add new drinks or configure the serialization process (e.g., storing the serialized file in an encrypted format).

## Usage

Build and run the lab3 project.
To add a drink, use the corresponding buttons on the left side of the application.
To delete a drink, click on it in the list of drinks.
To work with serialization and plugins, use the options available at the top of the application.
